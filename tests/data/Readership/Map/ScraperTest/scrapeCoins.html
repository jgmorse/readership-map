<p>Intolerance.<span class="ptr"><a name="N1"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[1]</a></span> The word  <span class="rend-i">intolerance</span>  is commonly understood as this ferocious passion that stirs one to hate people that are in the wrong. However, and so as not to confuse things that are quite different, we shall distinguish between two types of  <span class="rend-i">intolerance</span> , one ecclesiastical, the other secular.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical  <span class="rend-i">intolerance</span>  consists in considering as false any other religion than that which one practices, and in proving so against all odds, without pausing for any terror, for any human respect, even to the risk of one's life. In this entry, this kind of heroism that spurred so many martyrs in all the centuries where churches prevailed will not be dealt with in this entry.</p>
<p>Secular  <span class="rend-i">intolerance</span>  consists in completely ostracizing and in chasing, through all sorts of violent means, these that think differently from us about God and his cult.</p>
<p>A few lines taken from the Scriptures - from the Bible, from the priests, and from the councils - will prove enough to show that the  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span>  understood in the latter definition is an evil man, a bad Christian, a dangerous subject, a bad politician, and a bad citizen.</p>
<p>But before proceeding deeper, we must say, to the honor of our Catholic Theologians, that we found several that agreed to, and without the least restriction, what we are setting out to expose to the most respectable authorities.</p>
<p>Tertullien<span class="ptr"><a name="N2"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[2]</a></span> said in his treatise "Ad Scapulam:"<span class="ptr"><a name="N3"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[3]</a></span> <span class="rend-i">Humani juris &amp; naturalis potestatis est unicuique quod putaverit, colere; nec alii obest aut prodest alterius religio. Sed nec religionis est cogere religionem quoe sponte suscipi debeat, non vi; cum &amp; hostioe ab animo lubenti expostulentur</span> .<span class="ptr"><a name="N4"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Here is what the Christians that were weak and persecuted were advocating to the idolaters that were dragging them to the foot of their altars.</p>
<p>It is impious to expose a religion to the odious imputations of tyranny, of hardness, of injustice, of unsociability, even in the goal of bringing back those who might have strayed away from it.</p>
<p>The spirit can only agree to what seems right; the heart can only love what seems good. Violence will only turn a man into a hypocrite, if he is weak; into a martyr, if he is courageous. Weak or courageous, he will experience injustice and persecution, and he will become indignant.</p>
<p>Instruction, persuasion, and prayer, here are the only legitimate ways to spread religion.</p>
<p>Any means that would excite hatred, indignation, and scorn, is impious.</p>
<p>Any means that would awaken the passions and that would originate from interested views, is impious.</p>
<p>Any means that would distend natural bonds, and separate the father from the son, brothers from one another, sisters from one another, is impious.</p>
<p>Any means that would tend to have people revolt, to arm nations and to mire the earth with blood, is impious.</p>
<p>It is impious to wish to impose laws to the conscience, universal ruler of actions. Conscience should be enlightened, not constrained.</p>
<p>Men that err in good faith are to be pitied, never to be punished.</p>
<p>One should not torment men of good faith, or men of bad faith, but to surrender their judgment to God.</p>
<p>If one breaks the bond with an impious brother, one will break the bond with the avaricious, the immodest, the angry, the vicious. One would advise such a break to others, and three of four  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span>  persons will prove enough to rip out the fabric of society.</p>
<p>If one can pull a hair out from someone that thinks differently from us, then one could dispose of his head, because there are no limits to injustice. It will be left to either the interest, of the fanaticism, or the time, or the circumstance that will decide of the relative evil one will allow oneself.</p>
<p>If an infidel prince were to ask of the missionaries of an  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span>  religion how it deals with people who do not believe, they would have to confess something odious, or they would have to lie, or they would have to maintain a shameful silence.</p>
<p>What did Christ recommend his disciples by sending them to other countries? Was it to kill or die? Was it to persecute or suffer?</p>
<p>Saint Paul wrote to the people of Thessalonica:  <span class="rend-i">if someone comes to announce another Christ, offer you another spirit, preach another gospel, you will allow it</span> .  <span class="rend-i">Intolerants</span> , is this how you deal with one that does not announce anything, offer anything, preach anything?</p>
<p>He would write further:  <span class="rend-i">do not treat as an enemy one that does not share your feelings, but warn him as a brother</span> .  <span class="rend-i">Intolerants</span> , is this what you do?</p>
<p>If your opinions allow you to hate me, why is it that my opinions would not allow me to hate you as well?</p>
<p>Were you to shout, I have truth on my side, I will shout as high as you, since I have truth on my side; but I shall add: and what does it matter who is wrong between you and me, as long as there is peace among us? If I were blind, must you hit a blind man in the face?</p>
<p>If an  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span>  would explain clearly what he stands for, which corner of the earth would remain closed to him? And where would the sensible man be that would dare land in the country of the  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span> ?</p>
<p>One reads in Origene,<span class="ptr"><a name="N5"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[5]</a></span> in Minutius-Felix,<span class="ptr"><a name="N6"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[6]</a></span> in the fathers of the first three centuries:  <span class="rend-i">religion convinces and does not command. Man should be free in the choice of his cult; the persecutor has his God hated; the persecutor calumnies his religion</span> . Tell me if these maxims are the result of ignorance or imposture?</p>
<p>In an  <span class="rend-i">intolerant</span>  state, the prince will be but an executioner of the priest's orders. The prince is the common father of his subjects; and his apostolate is to make them all happy.</p>
<p>There are circumstances where one is as strongly convinced by error than by truth. Only one that has never been truly in error can deny this.</p>
<p>If your truth singles me out, my error that I consider truth will single you out.</p>
<p>Stop being violent, and stop blaming the Pagans and the Muslims for the violence.</p>
<p>When you hate your brother, and when you preach hate to your fellow man, does the spirit of God inspire you?</p>
<p>Christ said:  <span class="rend-i">my kingdom is not of this world</span> ; and you, his disciple, you want to tyrannize this world!</p>
<p>He said:  <span class="rend-i">I am sweet and humble at heart</span> ; are you sweet and humble at heart?</p>
<p>He said:  <span class="rend-i">blessed are the meek, the pacifists, and the forgiving</span> . Search your soul, and see whether you deserve this blessing; are you meek, pacifist, forgiving?</p>
<p>He said,  <span class="rend-i">I am the lamb that was taken to its death without complaint</span> ; and you are all ready to take the butcher's knife, and to slaughter one for which the blood of the lamb was spilled.</p>
<p>He said,  <span class="rend-i">if you are persecuted, flee</span> ; and you hunt down those who let you speak, and that ask for nothing more than to just live beside you peacefully.</p>
<p>He said:  <span class="rend-i">you wish I would shower your enemies with the fire from the sky: you do not know what spirit animates you</span> ; and I repeat it with you, intolerants, you do not know what spirit animates you.</p>
<p>Listen to Saint John:  <span class="rend-i">my children, love one another</span> .</p>
<p>Saint Athanasius:<span class="ptr"><a name="N7"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[7]</a></span> <span class="rend-i">if they persecute, this is but a proof that they have no pity or fear of God. It is pity's lot to convince, not constrain, much like the Savior, who let everyone free to follow him. As for the devil, since he has no truth, he comes with hatchets and weapons</span> .</p>
<p>Saint John Chrisostome:<span class="ptr"><a name="N8"></a> <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.564/--intolerance?id=N8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt;q1=Denis+Diderot+ascribed+by+Jacques+Proust">[8]</a></span> <span class="rend-i">Jesus Christ asks his disciples whether they want to flee as well; for such are the words of one that wants no violence</span> .</p>
<p>Salvien:  <span class="rend-i">These men err, but unknowingly. They err among us, but not among them. They feel they are such good Catholics that they call us heretics. What they think themselves against us, we think ourselves against them; they err, but with good intention. What will their future be? Only the great judge knows. In the meantime, he tolerates them</span> .</p>
<p>Saint Augustine:  <span class="rend-i">Let these mistreat you that have had no experience of how hard it is to find truth, and to prevent error. Let these mistreat you that do not know how rare and painful it is to overcome the phantoms of the flesh. Let these mistreat you, who are unaware if how long one must moan and sigh to understand anything from God. Let these mistreat you that never erred</span> .</p>
<p>Saint Hilaire.  <span class="rend-i">You use constraint for a cause where only reason is needed; you use force where only light is required</span> .</p>
<p>Pope Clement's constitutions.  <span class="rend-i">The Savior granted men free use of their will, since he did not punish them with a temporal death, but because he assigned another world to them, where they would have to account for their actions</span> .</p>
<p>The fathers of a council in Toledo.  <span class="rend-i">Do not enforce any sort of violence on anyone in order to bring him over to your faith; because God offers thankfulness to whom he wants, and he hardens whom he wishes</span> .</p>
<p>One would fill up volumes with these quotes, too often forgotten by Christians nowadays.</p>
<p>Saint Martin would repent for all his life to have communicated with heretical persecutors.</p>
<p>All wise men disapproved of the violence wreaked by Emperor Justinian onto the Samaritans.</p>
<p>These writers that supported and advised for the penal laws against incredulity, have all been hated.</p>
<p>In recent times, the apologist of the revocation of the Nantes Edict passed for a bloody man, with whom no roof should be shared.</p>
<p>What is humanity's path? Is it that of the striking persecutor, or that of the plaintive persecuted?</p>
<p>If the prince states that the unbelieving subject is unworthy to live, is it not to fear that the subject in his turn says that the infidel prince is unworthy to rule?  <span class="rend-i">Intolerants</span> , bloody men, observe the consequences of your principles and fear them. Men whom I love, whatever your feelings; it is for you that that I compiled these thoughts that I pray you meditate. Meditate them, and you will surrender an atrocious system that suits neither the spirit's rightfulness nor the heart's goodness.</p>
<p>Work on your redemption. Pray for mine, and believe that anything that you will allow beyond that is an abominable injustice in the eyes of God and of men.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><span class="notenumber">1. </span> Large excerpts of this entry can be found in a letter Diderot sent to his brother Didier, an abbot, on December 29th, 1760 (in  <span class="rend-i">Correspondance</span> , ed. Roth (Edition de Minuit, 1957), # 223, vol. 3, pp. 283-288). Diderot meant these "thoughts" as a "New Year's gift."</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">2. </span> Tertullien (in Latin Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus) (Carthage, ca 155 _ id., ca 220) was a Christian apologist. Considered a Father of the Church, he is considered the first Christian writer in Latin, a language in which he initiated a theological vocabulary.</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">3. </span> This treatise was written in 212 against the African Proconsul of the same name, who was a persecutor of Christians. In it, Tertullien militates energetically for political loyalty and for the freedom of conscience.</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">4. </span> My translation: "Each man receives both from law and nature the freedom to adore what he deems right: what good or bad does my religion do to another? It is contrary to any religion to force one to adore it, when it should be voluntarily chosen, not imposed by force, since any sacrifice requires the heart's assent."</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">5. </span> Origène (Alexandrie, ca 185 _ Tyr, ca. 254), theologian and Father of the Greek Church. A philosopher, he would teach in Alexandria, and later found a school of theology in Palestine. He wrote commentaries on the Scriptures, refuted the antichristian views from Celse, moral treatises on Christian practices.</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">6. </span> Is Diderot here referring to Felix 1st (Rome,? _ id., 274), Pope from 269 to 274?</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">7. </span> Athanase (Alexandrie, ca. 295 _ id., 373): doctor of the Church, and patriarch of Alexandria in 328. He was a staunch opponent of aryanism.</p>
<p><span class="notenumber">8. </span> Is Diderot referring to Jean ou Jean-Baptiste, a.k.a. the Precursor (died in Palestine ca. 28)? Born from the priest Zacharie, he will baptize Jesus and will designate him as the Messiah.</p>
